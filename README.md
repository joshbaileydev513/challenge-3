# Weekly Challenge 3

## Description

The motivation behind this weekly challenge was about refactor code for a specific ticket requesting using what we have learned so far in JavaScript. The goal of this was to simulate an on the job ticket or feature request by a boss or client. We were to follow a format that is typical to software teams in the field which is agile development, using items such as User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Mock Ups to complete the task. Once that was completed, we were to deploy those changes to GitHub pages. 

In this specific challenge, we contacted  to create and application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It will have a clean and polished, responsive US that adapts to multiple screen sizes. They provided some acceptance criteria along with a picture mockup to make sure their needs are met accurately. The main acceptance criteria were as follows:

- GIVEN I need a new, secure password
- WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
- WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
- WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
- WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

The main goal this problem would solve is the company using this application and ensure security their employees passwords and that they meet all the accepted criteria when making a new one. Another thing that was achived is the passwords should be safer in theory compared to anything they would come up with on their own as this is all randomly generated off of a few prompts from the user. 

Through this third challenge, I learned multiple hands on skils that will be used within the modern software development lifecycle and environment. Through this on the job ticket/feature request, I was able to put my JavaScript skills to the test to dynamically change what was once a static application and turn it into something that is dynamic and responds/stores user inputs. 

## Installation

To get this project installed you can find the core code at https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/challenge-3 . From there, click the green <>Code dropdown button and copy the HTTPS or SSH link within Clone. Once you have that copied, open up your CLI or GitBash and run the following commands:

git clone (paste your HTTPS or SSH link)

Or you can view the live page here: https://joshbaileydev513.github.io/challenge-3/

## Usage

To use the main functionality of this page, you will click on the generate password button which will then be followed by four prompts. The first prompt is what you want your password length to be (between 8-128 characters), followed by if you want lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers in your password. After all of those criteria are met, you are prompted with your new password to use based off the certain criteria. Below is a picture of what the deployed webpage will look like.
